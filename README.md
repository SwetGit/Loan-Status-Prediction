# Loan-Status-Prediction
This project focuses on a real-world classification problem commonly encountered in the insurance and banking domain, where analytics plays a critical role in automating decision-making systems.

Problem Statement-
An insurance company aims to automate the loan eligibility process in real-time, using customer information submitted through online application forms. The objective is to identify segments of customers eligible for loans based on factors such as:
Gender
Marital Status
Education Level
Number of Dependents
Applicant & Co-applicant Income
Loan Amount
Credit History
Property Area
Employment Status

Goal-
To build a machine learning classification model that accurately predicts whether a customer is eligible for a loan. The solution involves:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Handling categorical variables
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Model training and evaluation (using algorithms like SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.)
Drawing business insights from feature impact

Outcome-
This project not only simulates a real-life use case from the insurance domain but also highlights challenges such as handling missing values, and categorical encodingâ€”providing hands-on exposure to how data science enables smarter financial decision-making.
